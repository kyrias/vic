This is a Python 3 implementation of the pen-and-paper cipher used by the Soviet spy Reino Häyhänen, codenamed "VICTOR", in the 1950s.

If you have 3to2 from the PyPI installed you can just run ``make 3to2`` and you will end up with a copy of the cipher implementation in the ``3to2/`` subdirectory converted to run under Python 2.
